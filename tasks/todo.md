# Fab Run — Task Tracker

## Current: M0 — Move in

### Task: confirm the kit works and settle the M1 decisions
- [ ] GitHub Pages on; placeholder loads on desktop and phone (David turns on Pages; local check passed, see notes)
- [x] `npm test` passes
- [x] Decide D7, O2, O4, O5, O6 with David; move them to Settled in `docs/decisions.md` (O8 settled too)

**Progress notes:**
- 23 Oct 2026: `npm test` 7/7 pass. Served locally (`python3 -m http.server 8000`) and loaded in headless Chromium at 1280×800 and 375×812: 9 room tiles, counts 10/5/4/4/9, no console errors or warnings, no horizontal scroll at 375 px.
- 23 Oct 2026: David settled D7 = B (plain ES modules), O2 = A (time per room; cash for procurement only), O4 as proposed, O5 = A (inlaid Cu line), O6 = A (hand of 5), O8 = keep "Fab Run". CLAUDE.md §4 already matches D7, so no change there.
- Still open: live Pages check at https://chirality89.github.io/fab-run/ once Pages is on.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- The live page shows the title, the room key and the content counts, with no console errors
- `docs/decisions.md` has no open decision that blocks M1

## NEEDS NEW LOGIC

Content in `src/content/content.js` that needs engine behavior beyond the eight effect operations:

- `when: { lot: 'tightCD' | 'deepEtch' | 'narrowFeatures' }`: lot-type properties, set in `lotTypes.js` (M1)
- `when: { lot: 'delayBeforeBake' }`: needs a timer between the litho expose and bake practices
- `when: { lot: 'lastStepWasLitho' }`: needs route history in the lot state
- `when: { lot: 'rightPartChosen' }` and `needsTarget: 'faultType'`: the spare part asks the player to pick a fault
- `resets: { slot, field, fraction }`: fresh resist and bath analysis reset a material's shelf life or decay
- `limit: { perLayer: 1 }`: strip and re-expose once per layer
- `shelfLife`: counts rooms visited; at 0 the material stops helping
